      They're not exactly desks, more like tables that are
      bolted to the floor in stadium-style rows.  It looks

      the back.

      It is a fat, high-quality piece of Japanese chalk,
      with the word "Hagoromo" written on the side in
      black letters.  You seem to recall that Dr. Yorgey
      always uses this kind of chalk.  Perhaps he
      accidentally left it here after teaching Algorithms.

      You return the chalk to Dr. Yorgey, who seems very grateful.

      The blackboard has several pictures of graphs traced
      over in yellow, green, blue, and orange chalk, along
      with lots of writing.  You can make out a few words
      like "lemma" and "theorem", but the rest seems to be
      about things like "flows" and "cuts" and "values".
      You realize it is probably left over from Algorithms.
